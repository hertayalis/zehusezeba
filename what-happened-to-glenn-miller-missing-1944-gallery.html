He put his musical career on hold in 1942 to join the U.S. forces battling the Axis in Europe.

Then, in 1943, Miller was summoned by General Dwight Eisenhower to put together entertainment for the U.S. troops in England.</p><p>Miller took his 60-member band across the pond in June 1944. Being closer to the front lines of the war, Miller and his band members had some close calls when the Germans bombed parts of the U.K.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Following the invasion of France, Glenn Miller was set to play for Allied troops in Paris on Christmas Day in 1944.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Miller’s band was scheduled to perform for Allied troops in Paris on Christmas Day in 1944 and he planned to get to Paris early to coordinate accommodations, but the weather wasn’t cooperating. After two of his flights on Dec. 13 and 14 were canceled due to bad weather, Miller was able to hitch a ride on a Dec. 15 flight with his friend Colonel Norman Baessell.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">However, Miller's plane never arrived in Paris after departing from the United Kingdom.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The flight wasn’t formally approved, as per standard military protocol, and Miller wasn’t officially listed on the flight manifest, so it wasn’t until the band arrived in Paris on Dec. 18 and Miller wasn’t there that an investigation started into his whereabouts.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Miller was officially declared dead in December 1945, with his plane never being located.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Miller’s disappearance was officially announced to the press on Dec. 24, 1944.

When the fisherman told the Coast Guard what he’d found, they told him it was probably a "war grave" and to get rid of it, so he left it at the bottom of the English Channel, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS</a> reported in 2019.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">It's believed that Glenn Miller's plane crashed somewhere in the English Channel.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"In 1987 trawling in the English Channel, he pulled up an airplane wreck that he later realized looked like the kind of airplane that Glenn Miller disappeared in. He called the Coast Guard and described it. They said, 'Well, if it's a World War II plane it might be a war grave, just get rid of it,'" Ric Gillespie from the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery explained.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The fisherman didn't know the importance of the discovery at the time, and was told to leave the potential grave alone.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The fisherman made a note of where he found the plane, but it wasn't until years later that he saw a picture of what Miller's Norseman aircraft looked like and realized that the wreckage he found might be of the plane that Miller was in.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Miller's plane was the only one of its type to go missing during the war.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Gillespie, who is also searching for Amelia Earhart's missing plane, said that it should be easy to confirm the aircraft was the one that Miller was on.

"But it's a c--------. This stuff is really hard and there's a good chance you're going to get skunked! That's what this game is like. You can't find something if you don't try to find it but that's the call we're going to have to make."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">For now, Gillespie is trying to dispel some common myths around Miller's disappearance.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"Right now, if you really look at the facts of the case, there really isn't much doubt at all that the airplane went down in the English Channel," says Gillespie. "They probably just iced up and went into the channel. But we don't know. With a mystery as popular and iconic as the Miller disappearance, there will always be conspiracy theories and adherence to other theories. Finding the wreckage answers the question finally. You can say, 'There it is. We can now put that to bed.' That's what we're out to do: replace mystery with documented history."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSgpJWju265yKWjnqpdora0v8innmZpaWmBbrPApaOeqqk%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-glenn-miller-missing-1944-gallery.html&text=Glenn%20Miller%20Disappeared%20in%201944%20%20Plane%20Might%20Have%20Been%20Located&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-glenn-miller-missing-1944-gallery.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-glenn-miller-missing-1944-gallery.html&title=Glenn%20Miller%20Disappeared%20in%201944%20%20Plane%20Might%20Have%20Been%20Located" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-glenn-miller-missing-1944-gallery.html&title=Glenn%20Miller%20Disappeared%20in%201944%20%20Plane%20Might%20Have%20Been%20Located" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-glenn-miller-missing-1944-gallery.html&title=Glenn%20Miller%20Disappeared%20in%201944%20%20Plane%20Might%20Have%20Been%20Located" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-glenn-miller-missing-1944-gallery.html&description=Glenn%20Miller%20Disappeared%20in%201944%20%20Plane%20Might%20Have%20Been%20Located" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./harry-potter-star-bonnie-wright-28-displays-sensational-physique-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Harry Potter starBonnie Wright, 28, displays her sensational physique">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./beyonce-and-jay-zs-children-will-grow-up-in-this-incredible-200m-home-all-we-know.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Beyonce and Jay-Z's children will grow up in this incredible $200M home - all we know">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
