In the early 1500s, Spanish conquerors found the Incas growing the vegetable, which the Spanish called patata. They were taken back to Europe and eventually reached England where the name changed to potato.</span></span><h2>Are potatoes originally from Ireland?</h2>However, the potato was not a native of Ireland. It had been found by Spanish conquistadors in south America in the 1500s was shipped to Europe, and reached Ireland around 1590. For the next 80 years it was grown in small numbers, mainly in Munster, as a garden crop or stand-by.<h2>Why is Ireland associated with potatoes?</h2>Why were potatoes so important to Ireland? The potato plant was hardy, nutritious, calorie-dense, and easy to grow in Irish soil. By the time of the famine, nearly half of Ireland's population relied almost exclusively on potatoes for their diet, and the other half ate potatoes frequently.<h2>Is Irish and potato the same thing?</h2>A name used to refer to different varieties of white potatoes. Potatoes were a major crop in Ireland and were brought to New England by the Irish immigrants in the beginning of the 18th century.

The Irish immigrants brought the culture of potato to the United States.<h2>What potatoes are Irish?</h2>The most common types of Irish potatoes are red or white. Most red varieties store longer than do white varieties; on the other hand, most white varieties have better cooking qualities than red varieties. Many gardeners plant some of each in the spring. The whites are used first and the reds stored for later use.<h2>Which continent are potatoes native to?</h2>Potatoes were domesticated there approximately 7,000–10,000 years ago, from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex. In the Andes region of South America, where the species is indigenous, some close relatives of the potato are cultivated.<h2>What is a traditional Irish dish?</h2>Representative dishes include Irish stew, bacon and cabbage, boxty, soda bread (predominantly in Ulster), coddle, and colcannon. Modern Irish food still uses traditional ingredients, but they are now being cooked by chefs with world influences and are presented in a more modern and artistic style.<h2>What food is Ireland known for?</h2><p>Don't leave Ireland without trying...</p><ul><li>Soda bread.

Often referred to as the Emerald Isle, Ireland has vibrant cities tucked beside cozy bays and sheer cliffs. Ireland is where snug pubs, pints of Guinness and shots of Irish Whiskey go hand-in-hand with hearty Irish homestyle cooking.<h2>Did the Irish bring potatoes to America?</h2>1719 – Potatoes had been introduced to the United States several times throughout the 1600s. They were not widely grown for almost a century until 1719, when they were planted in Londonderry, New Hampshire, by Scotch-Irish immigrants, and from there spread across the nation.<h2>What did they eat in Ireland before potatoes?</h2>Grains, either as bread or porridge, were the other mainstay of the pre-potato Irish diet, and the most common was the humble oat, usually made into oatcakes and griddled (ovens hadn't really taken off yet).<h2>Is Ireland famous for potatoes?</h2>To this day, the potato has remained a staple of the Irish diet. Whether it be mashed, roasted, sautéed, or even added to a stew, you are in fact very likely to find it somewhere on your plate in an Irish household.<h2>Are potatoes indigenous to Europe?</h2>Originating from the highlands of the Andes, South America, potatoes were introduced to Europe in the sixteenth century. They were initially popular in Spain because they provided cheap sustenance for the poor.<h2>Who invented the potato?</h2>The potato was the first domesticated vegetable in the region of modern-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia between 8000 and 5000 BCE.<h2>Where did the potato come from Ireland or South America?</h2>The potato first made its appearance in Europe about 1570, having been brought from South America by the Spaniards. Traditional wisdom has it that Sir Walter Raleigh introduced the crop to Ireland about 1585. As a staple diet for the native population, it proved to be ideal.<h2>Is a russet potato an Irish potato?</h2>Russets are the primary variety group grown in Idaho, representing approximately 50% of the 315,000 acres grown annually.
