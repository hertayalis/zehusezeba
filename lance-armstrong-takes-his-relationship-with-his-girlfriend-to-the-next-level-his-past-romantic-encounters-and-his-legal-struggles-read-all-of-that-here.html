YES!!!!”</p><p>The couples are seen gazing at each other with their arms wrapped around each other. Anna Hansen is showing off her diamond ring to the camera.</p><p>The couple met in July 2008 at a charity function and started dating. In December 2008, they announced that Anna Hansen was expecting. Anna Hansen has <a href=#>two children with Lance Armstrong</a>; Max, 7, and Olivia, 6.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/la-1.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lance%E2%80%99s_previous_affairs></span><u>Lance’s previous affairs</u><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lance met editor and blogger <a href=#>Kristin Richard</a> in June 1997 and tied the knot in May 1998. Lance Armstrong had undergone surgery and chemotherapy for testicular cancer. Prior to the surgery, he had banked his sperms.</p><p>These sperms were utilized for impregnating Kristin and they have 3 children together; son Luke and twin daughters Grace and Isabella. They divorced in 2003. The same year, Lance Armstrong started a relationship with country singer-songwriter <a href=#>Sheryl Crow</a>.</p><p>In September 2005, they got engaged only to split in February 2006. Lance dated American fashion designer Tory Burch from March to October 2007. He met American actress <a href=#>Kate Hudson</a> in the Bahamas in May 2008 and dated her for three months.</p><p>In July 2008, he met Anna Hansen. Their relationship rapidly progressed to the stage that in December 2008, Lance Armstrong announced that she was pregnant.</p><p>The child was born naturally though he was told by doctors that he could no longer father children due to his past surgery and chemotherapy. Both had another child, a daughter a year later.</p><p>In March 2017, speaking about his relationship with the country superstar Sheryl Crow, Lance had said:</p><p>“It was a good ride. She’s a great lady. Obviously it didn’t work out, but I think and I hope she’s happy.”</p><p>Explaining the reason for their separation, Lance said:</p><p>“She wanted marriage, she wanted children; and not that I didn’t want that, but I didn’t want that at that time because I had just gotten out of a marriage, I’d just had kids. Yet we’re up against her biological clock — that pressure is what cracked it.”</p><p>He added that it was difficult to continue since there are pressures of being a power couple.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/la-ah-instagram.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=His_dark_side></span><u>His dark side</u><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lance Armstrong was accused repeatedly of taking performance-enhancing drugs. He, however, denied them and boasted that he never had any positive urine tests in his career.</p><p>He was alleged to have paid Dr. Michele Ferrari secretly money to inject him with recombinant erythropoietin (rhEPO) which is considered an illegal performance-enhancing drug.</p><p>In 1999, when his urine test showed traces of corticosteroids, Lance Armstrong procured pre-dated medical certificates and prescriptions to show that he had used steroid creams for his saddle sores, which could possibly explain the false-positive urine tests.</p><p>He even sued The Sunday Times (UK) for libel for an article accusing him of doping. The tabloid was forced to a do out-of-court settlement with Lance.</p><p>One of Lance’s personal assistants Mike Anderson told the court on one occasion that he had seen a box of androstenone while cleaning the star’s bathroom in his Spain apartments.</p><p>In 2005, Lance’s frozen urine samples were tested for EPO and found to contain the drug. Lance restated that he did not take any banned drugs, being aware of the shortcomings of the test.</p><p>Lance also had litigation ongoing with SCA Promotions over bonus money. The Company paid him the money as an out-of-court settlement but later in 2012 following the publication of the USADA (United States anti-doping agency) reasoned decision, made a fresh case of fraud against Lance in order to recover the money wrongly paid to him. Lance was banned from all sports for a lifetime.</p><p>Lance Armstrong had gained a lot of fame but by the wrong means and hence he was stripped of all the titles of his Tour de France.</p><p>In 2013 on the <a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a> show, Lance Armstrong admitted to doping. In February 2015, a panel ruled in favor of SCA.</p><p>Referring to Lance Armstrong, the panel stated:</p><p>&nbsp;“Perjury must never be profitable” and “it is almost certainly the most devious sustained deception ever perpetrated in world sporting history.”</p><p>Finding himself cornered, Lance issued a formal, public apology and agreed to pay SCA an undisclosed sum.</p><p>Soon after the SCA panel’s decision against him, Lance Armstrong pleaded guilty in a hit-and-run accident of December 2014. He had allegedly rammed into 2 cars in Aspen, Colorado.</p><p>Initially, his girlfriend Anna Hansen took the blame on her. The police however suspected that Lance Armstrong was the culprit and they interviewed a valet who also mentioned the fact that it was Lance who was behind the wheels.</p><p>Anna and Lance had mutually decided that Anna would take the blame to protect the family but their plan fell apart and Lance sent in his plea via email.</p><p>He was charged with reckless driving and the other 2 charges of speeding and failure to report the incident were subsequently dropped.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/la-with-family-daily-mail.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Short_Bio_on_Lance_Armstrong></span><u>Short Bio on Lance Armstrong</u><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lance Armstrong is an American former professional road racing cyclist.
