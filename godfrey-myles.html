He died in the early morning of June 10, 2011; he was 42 years old.</p><p>On April 15, 1997, he was signed as a free agent by the Denver Broncos. He was waived on August 20.</p><p>Myles returned to the Cowboys for his final season in 1996, but his playing time was reduced and he never started again. In his six-season NFL career with the Cowboys, he was overshadowed by other players and was mainly used as a backup linebacker and special teams player. During that period the team won three Super Bowls (XXVII, XXVIII, XXX), and he finished with 135 tackles and two interceptions.</p><p>In 1995, with <a href=#>Darrin Smith</a> holding out for most of the season, he started the first 7 games at weakside linebacker and 4 games at middle linebacker in place of an injured Jones. He finished third on the team with 99 tackles, while playing through a separated shoulder and helping the team win Super Bowl XXX.</p><p>In 1994, he competed for the middle linebacker position after Norton left in free agency, but the job went to <a href=#>Robert Jones</a>. He was a backup to all three linebacker positions, collecting 13 tackles and one quarterback pressure. During the NFC championship game, he was forced into early action after Edwards was lost with a dislocated shoulder.</p><p>In 1993, the recovery process from his injury took him until week 9 against the Philadelphia Eagles to return. He was a backup at strongside linebacker behind <a href=#>Dixon Edwards</a> and tallied 17 tackles. It has been speculated that he was never the same player after the injury.</p><p>In 1992, he was Ken Norton's backup at strongside linebacker, playing mostly on passing downs, while registering 21 defensive tackles, 9 special teams tackles, 2 quarterback pressures, one pass defensed and one interception. He was the starter at outside linebacker in Super Bowl XXVII when he suffered a freak injury, tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee during a touchdown celebration, after he was shoved from behind, slipped and twisted his right knee.</p><p>Myles was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the third round (62nd overall) of the 1991 NFL Draft. As a rookie, he was limited in the preseason with pain in his right shoulder, caused by a screw, from a surgery while at college, that was too long and tore at the muscle. He played in the first 4 games, before being placed on the injured reserve list on September 25.</p><p>Because he was a superb athlete with excellent size and speed, when defensive coordinator <a href=#>Jim Bates</a> installed a 4-4-3 defense in 1990, Myles was moved to the "Gatorback" hybrid position, that combined the functions of an outside linebacker with a strong safety. He started 11 games, posting 69 tackles (third on the team), 3.5 sacks (third on the team), 10 tackles for loss and 4 passes defensed.</p><p>Myles accepted a football scholarship from the University of Florida, where he played for coach <a href=#>Galen Hall</a> and coach Steve Spurrier's Florida Gators football teams from 1987 to 1990.</p><p>Myles attended Miami Carol City High School in Miami Gardens. As a senior in 1986, he was a second-team All-state and All-County linebacker, helping the football team reach the section 4-5A championship game. As a senior, He also ran the 100-meter, 200-meter and anchored the 400-meter relay team.</p><p>Godfrey Clarence Myles (September 22, 1968 – June 10, 2011) was an American football linebacker in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys. He played college football at the University of Florida.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfnLylstGesGalqaGytA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgodfrey-myles.html&text=Godfrey%20Myles%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgodfrey-myles.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgodfrey-myles.html&title=Godfrey%20Myles%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgodfrey-myles.html&title=Godfrey%20Myles%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgodfrey-myles.html&title=Godfrey%20Myles%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgodfrey-myles.html&description=Godfrey%20Myles%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-should-you-spend-on-a-wedding-ring.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How much should you spend on a wedding ring?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./future-net-worth-146151.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Future Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
