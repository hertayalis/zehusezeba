To the knowledge of very few, she is also the current incarnation of the Ancient Weapon Poseidon, which has great destructive power.

Despite her massive form, Shirahoshi is naïve and has the heart of a child. She has dreams of exploring the world just like her mother wanted to. Known to be a crybaby, the young princess made a promise to Luffy to become a stronger and better person which portrays her willingness to grow.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>8. Koala</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=623 data-current-count=923 data-injectable=true>Koala’s story is an unforgettable and heartbreaking one. As a young child, Koala was kidnapped and sold into slavery to the Celestial Dragons. She and many other slaves were saved by a Fish-Man called Fisher Tiger. She was then assisted by the Sun Pirates to return to her home. Despite the deep trauma of her time being a slave under Mary Geoise, Koala made the choice to join the Revolutionary Army at the age of 14 and soon rose up the ranks in the organization. Koala is a great example of overcoming one’s trauma and hardships as she took advantage of those and used them to fight against oppression and injustice.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>7. Vinsmoke Reiju</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=696 data-current-count=996 data-injectable=true>Elder sister of Sanji and the only daughter of the Vinsmoke family, Reiju is the princess of the Germa Kingdom. She is also a commander in the kingdom’s military army, Germa 66. Due to her possession of poison-based powers, she is popularly called Poison Pink.

During the entire Whole Cake Island arc, Reiju was an ally of the Straw Hat Pirates and soon became a fan favorite. Her internal struggle to reconcile her family’s dark past with her own morality makes her a fascinating character.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>6. Nefertari Vivi</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=667 data-current-count=967 data-injectable=true>From princess to spy, Vivi is the daughter of Nefertari Cobra and Titi.

Her presence as both a villain and a mother figure highlights the intricate weaving of character arcs in One Piece.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>3. Boa Hancock</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=658 data-current-count=958 data-injectable=true>Boa Hancock is a former warlord and the only female to become a Warlord of the seas.

Nami</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=588 data-current-count=888 data-injectable=false>Topping our list, of course, is the beloved Nami.
