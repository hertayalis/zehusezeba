started operations in 1980, Lou Dobbs net worth could not have been lower than the estimated $20 million that he has earned over the course of his career.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He has made money in his career.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>And that is down to his hard work.</p><p>Now at 76 years old, he can look back at his work and be proud of himself.</p><p>Since we are discussing Lou Dobbs net worth, let’s look at some issues that had to do with money and some legal issues.</p><p>On February 4, 2021, the maker of voting machines Smartmatic filed a $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit against a number of people, including Dobbs and two other hosts of Fox Corporation programs, alleging that they had spread rumors that the company and its rival Dominion Voting Systems had been involved in a global plot to rig the 2020 presidential election against Donald Trump.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>After receiving a demand letter from Smartmatic, the three programs each ran a video retraction weeks earlier; nevertheless, neither Dobbs nor the other hosts personally made retractions.</p><p>In December 2021, Venezuelan businessman Majed Khalil filed a $250 million lawsuit against Dobbs, Fox News, and Sidney Powell, claiming that they had wrongly accused him of manipulating Dominion and Smartmatic devices.</p><p>READ ALSO: <a href=#>Debi Segura: Everything You Need to Know About Lou Dobbs Wife</a></p><p>In March 2022, a judge for the New York State Supreme Court decided that the Smartmatic lawsuit against Fox News could go on, tossing out claims against two people but upholding those against Dobbs.</p><p>On February 5, 2021, Fox News terminated the program.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The decision had reportedly been taken into consideration prior to the legal troubles with Smartmatic, according to the Los Angeles Times.</p><p>CNN asserted that despite having the greatest ratings on the Fox Business Network, the show was a loss leader because so many advertisers shied away from the material.</p><p>The eventual cancellation of the program and the fact that no money came in through the show, had impacted Lou Dobbs net worth.</p><p>If the program continued to run, he would have earned a bit more money from it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lou Dobbs Net Worth: Career</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

degree from Harvard University in the late 1960s.</p><p>He moved to Arizona and started working as a police and fire reporter for a local station after working for several anti-poverty organizations on the East Coast.</p><p>He started working for CNN in 1980 when the network first launched, and he remained there until 1999.</p><p>In 2001, he returned to CNN, but in 2009, he left once more.</p><p>He presented “Lou Dobbs Tonight” from 2011 to 2021, which rose to the top spot on the Fox Business Network in terms of ratings.</p><p>Following Fox’s cancellation of Dobbs’ show, the program was terminated in February 2021.</p><p>It is not surprising that Lou Dobbs net worth is that high.</p><p>READ ALSO: <a href=#>What is CNN’s Erin Burnett Salary And Net Worth?</a></p><h2

University.</p><p>Harvard accepted him, and he earned a Bachelor of Arts in economics there in 1967.</p><p>Dobbs resided in Quincy House while attending Harvard, and he was chosen for the Owl
