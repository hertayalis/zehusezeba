埼玉県熊谷市を拠点に活動し、熱狂的なファンを獲得しています。
舐達麻は過去も現在も凄まじいゴシップが続き、良くも悪くも業界から注目される存在です。
過去にメンバーの死亡、逮捕など散々なことがありましたが、それらの話題についてまとめて書いてみたいと思います。
舐達麻の現在のメンバーの賽 a.k.a. BADSAIKUSH、G-PLANTS、DELTA9KID。脱退したDbubbles 舐達麻は2009年に結成された埼玉県熊谷市を拠点に活動するヒップホップグループです。
前身は「49」（フォーティーナイン）というグループです。
グループ名の舐達麻のの由来は、命名の際にたまたま読んでいた「実話ナックルズ」でライターの「舐めダルマ親方」の名前を見て、ピンと来たそうです。
2015年にファーストアルバム「NORTHERN BLUE1.0.4.」、2019年に2ndアルバ「GODBREATH BUDDHACESS」がiTunesHIPHOPカテゴリーのアルバムランキングで一位を記録。
界隈だけでなく国内ヒップホップ業界の中でも名が知られたグループです。
ポピュラー音楽研究者の大和田俊之さんは「舐達麻の曲に潜むポエジー（詩情）は、日本のラップミュージックの表現を確実に更新したといえる」と、専門家にも舐達麻の音楽性は評価されています。
現在、メンバーは3人です。

中学卒業と同時に暴走族に入り、母から修学旅行を勧められ高校に進学しますがすぐに退学してしまいます。
その後に地元にあったポッセ49に加入し、ラップを始めました。
2009年6月の19歳の頃に、金庫破り事件で逮捕され少年院に1年ほど過ごしました。出所後に舐達麻を結成して現在までに至ります。
20歳から数年間は覚醒剤を使用しており、昔の写真の左前腕には注射痕が多数存在します。覚醒剤の副作用で右耳が聞こえなくなり、手術をしても治らないそうです。
元々、自分の運命は自分で決めるという思いがありサイコロや賽銭箱という意味がある「賽」というMCネームで活動していました。
昔から「まあや」さんと呼ばれる女性が彼女と噂されており、その後に子供がいる発言。</description></item><item><title>Daisy Fuentes shows off future godson</title><link>/daisy-fuentes-s.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/daisy-fuentes-s.html</guid><description>Cuban model/TV personality, Daisy Fuentes (l), and Mexican actor Eduardo Verastegui, couldn’t stop showing off their future godson, Pablito, 6 months, during a photo shoot on March 3rd in Los Angeles.
