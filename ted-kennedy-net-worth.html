He was the youngest son of Joseph P. Kennedy, and youngest brother of President <a href=#>John F. Kennedy</a>. His career was active from 1962 until 2009 when he passed away.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Ted Kennedy was, at the time of his death? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Ted Kennedy`s net worth was as high as $49 million, an amount acquired largely through his successful career as a politician.</p><h3>Ted Kennedy Net Worth $49 Million</h3><p>Ted was also the younger brother Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and took over the family mantle when the latter was assassinated in 1968. His family moved often when he was a child, which led to poor education, as he attended more than five schools before his teens. He then went to Milton Academy prep school, and had average grades, finishing 36th in class. After high school, Ted enrolled at Harvard College, but was expelled after caught cheating in tests; in 1951 he joined the United States Army, and stayed there for two years, stationed in Europe. He was discharged in 1953 as a private first class.</p><p>He then became a Harvard student again, and his grades improved, graduating in 1956 with a BAin history and government. Following graduation, Ted tried to enroll Harvard Law school, but his grades weren`t good enough, and instead he was accepted by the University of Virginia School of Law.</p><p>While at University, Ted`s career officially began, as he was appointed as manager of his brother John’s 1958 Senate re-election campaign. After finishing education in 1959, he was accepted into the Massachusetts Bar, but the following year Ted managed John`s successful presidential campaign, and then started his own campaign for a senate spot, which was left vacant when John became president. In the 1964 elections, he was elected as the United States Senator from Massachusetts, serving a full six years in the first mandate. After that, he was re-elected seven more times, serving until his death in 2009. During this time, his net worth increased by a large margin.</p><p>Apart from being a senator, Ted held several other prestigious positions, which also added a considerable amount to his net worth. From 1969 he was the chief Senate spokesperson for the Democratic party, as Senate Majority Whip, and from January 3rd 1979 until January 3rd 1981 served as the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. Six years later he became the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, and served in that position until 1995.</p><p>Ted`s net worth also increased through his work as an author, publishing several books, including the “Decisions for a Decade: Policies and Programs for the 1970s” (1968), “America Back On Track” (2006), and “True Compass” (2009), among others.</p><p>During his life, Ted received several prestigious awards and recognitions, including the Freedom medal in 1999, and honorary knighthood granted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2009, a few months before his death.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Ted was married twice; his first wife was Joan Bennet Kennedy, with whom he had three children. The couple met while he was still at University of Virginia School of Law, and they married in 1958, but divorced in 1982.His se cond wife was <a href=#>Victoria Reggie Kennedy</a>; the couple married in 1993, and their marriage lasted until Ted`s death. Once he was diagnosed with brain cancer, Victoria became his caregiver, looking after him and his needs until he died.</p><p>From 2008 his health began to decline, and he suffered a seizure and was brought to hospital, where doctors diagnosed malignant glioma, which is a brain tumor. Doctors told him that the tumor can`t be operated on, however, Ted didn`t surrender, and looked for all possible options. He underwent brain surgery, which was considered successful, however, seizures continued, and his physical strength suffered, as he lost weight, and was quite weak. Nevertheless, he returned to his job, and even attended President Obama`s inauguration, after which he suffered yet another seizure. In 2009, the tumor returned, and fifteen months after the original diagnosis, Ted lost the battle to the incurable disease. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Washington, next to his brothers John and Robert.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=16.110612855007><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$49 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 22, 1932</td></tr><tr><td>Died</td><td>2009-08-25</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Dorchester, Boston, Massachusetts, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.8 m</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Profession</td><td>Former United States Senator</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Education</td><td>Harvard University, University of Virginia School of Law, Milton Academy, University of Virginia</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Virginia Joan Bennett Victoria Anne "Vicki" Reggie</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Children</td><td>Patrick J.
