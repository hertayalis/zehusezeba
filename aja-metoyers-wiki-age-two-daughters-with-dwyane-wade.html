He is a former basketball player who spent most of his career playing in the National Basketball Association (NBA) with the Miami Heat team – Dwyane won three NBA championships, and was an NBA All-Star 13 times.</p><p>Dwyane was raised in Chicago alongside his sister Tragil and two half-siblings from his mother’s prior affairs, by his mother JoLinda – she and his father Dwyane Wade Sr. divorced when Dwyane was four months old. The children remained with their mother but who was a drug addict, and occasionally found herself in jail, so Dwyane eventually went to live with his father and his new wife.</p><p>He began playing basketball while attending Harold L. Richards High School, partly to stay away from gangs and drugs. Upon matriculating in 2000, he <a rel=nofollow href=#>enrolled at Marquette University</a> on a basketball scholarship, and was coached by Tom Crean. As he became the Most Valuable Player (MVP) during his third year, Dwyane decided to drop out of college and make himself available to play in the NBA.</p><p>He was drafted by the Miami Heat in 2003 – he was invited to the All-Star Game for the first time in 2006, while the same year saw him win the Finals MVP Trophy making him the fifth youngest player in the history of NBA to win the award. The 2006, 2007 and 2008 seasons saw Dwyane suffer many injuries missing 23 games in 2007 and 21 games in 2008. He stayed with the Miami Heat until 2016, when he signed a two-year contract with the Chicago Bulls worth $47 million, then on 24 September 2017, he signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers.</p><p>In February 2018, Dwyane was traded back to the Miami Heat, becoming one of three basketball players to score four thousand rebounds, 1,500 steals, 800 blocks, 5,000 assists, 20,000 points and 500 three-pointers.</p><p>Dwyane played his final game on 9 April 2019, and then retired from basketball and on 7 January 2020 – his number three jersey was retired by the Miami Heat.</p><p>Dwyane also played national basketball. He competed with the US National Team in 2004 Olympics and 2006 World Championships winning bronze each time, before the team won gold at the 2008 Summer Olympics after beating Spain in the finals.</p><p>Before meeting Aja and Gabrielle, Dwyane was married to Siohvaughn Funches, his high school sweetheart – they exchanged vows in 2002 but divorced in 2010, with Dwyane given custody over their two kids. He has a daughter with Gabrielle born on 7 November 2018. In 2020, one of Dwyane’s sons aged 12 came out as a transgender girl and changed his name to Zaya.</p><p>Dwyane is a passionate philanthropist who founded Wade’s World Foundation in 2003, which aims to help underprivileged children – on 24 December 2008, Dwyane bought a home for a woman whose house burned down. He has also helped raise money for those hit by the Haiti earthquake in 2010, and was once the ambassador of the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital’s Hoops for St. Jude initiative.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqvqrvGq5ipoKljvLOzjpqhmmWdmsGwxcSrqmavmaC2bq3GnmStr59isaLBxqGrnqqjYsSqwMdmm7CxkaOybsPAnZxo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2faja-metoyers-wiki-age-two-daughters-with-dwyane-wade.html&text=Aja%20Metoyer%27s%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Two%20Daughters%20With%20Dwyane%20Wade&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2faja-metoyers-wiki-age-two-daughters-with-dwyane-wade.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2faja-metoyers-wiki-age-two-daughters-with-dwyane-wade.html&title=Aja%20Metoyer%27s%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Two%20Daughters%20With%20Dwyane%20Wade" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2faja-metoyers-wiki-age-two-daughters-with-dwyane-wade.html&title=Aja%20Metoyer%27s%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Two%20Daughters%20With%20Dwyane%20Wade" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2faja-metoyers-wiki-age-two-daughters-with-dwyane-wade.html&title=Aja%20Metoyer%27s%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Two%20Daughters%20With%20Dwyane%20Wade" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2faja-metoyers-wiki-age-two-daughters-with-dwyane-wade.html&description=Aja%20Metoyer%27s%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Two%20Daughters%20With%20Dwyane%20Wade" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./avengers-infinity-war-empire-elizabeth-olsen.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Elizabeth Olsen Calls Out Empire For Photoshopping Her Avengers: Infinity War Cover">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-alphacool-core-ocean-t38-360mm-aio-cpu-cooler-review.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The AlphaCool Core Ocean T38 360mm AIO CPU Cooler Review: Loud and Proud">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
