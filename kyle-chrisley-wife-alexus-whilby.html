Todd Chrisley is one of the famous businessmen in America. The real estate tycoon is often criticized for his materialistic and affluent way of life. While Todd paid no heed to the criticisms, he might be starting to have second doubts. While most of Chrisley’s kids have gone on to lead normal lives, Kyle Chrisley is the sole exception. With drugs, mental troubles, and suicide attempts, Kyle went down the wrong hole. But Kyle managed to turn things around when it mattered and it won’t be an exaggeration to say all with the help of his ex-wife Alexus Whilby. In this article, we take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Alexus Whilby.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Wiki/Bio Facts</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tr><th>Fact</th><th>Description</th></tr><tbody readability=14.5><tr><td>Full name</td><td>Alexus Whilby</td></tr><tr><td>Date of birth</td><td>1991</td></tr><tr><td>Place of birth</td><td>Georgia, USA</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Ethnicity</td><td>Afro-American with Jamaican roots</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Gender</td><td>Femlae</td></tr><tr><td>Sexuality</td><td>Straight</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 3 inches (160cm)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>121 lbs (55 kg)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Body Measurements</td><td>32-23-34 (in inch) 81-58-86 (in cm)</td></tr><tr><td>Eye color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Hair color</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Bachelor’s degree in Biopsychology from Oglethorpe University</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Occupation</td><td>Businesswoman, co-owner and director of Home Designs and Business Development and Whilby’s Company, LLC; account manager at ATLA Language Service</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Net worth</td><td>Estimated to be around $1 million</td></tr><tr><td>Ex-husband</td><td>Kyle Chrisley (m. 2014)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>None (stepmother to Chloe Chrisley, Kyle’s daughter from his previous marriage)</td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Divorced</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Television appearance</td><td>Chrisley Knows Best (season 1)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Music career</td><td>Released a song called Shame On You with Kyle in 2014</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Family background</td><td>Daughter of the late Isaac Samuel Whilby and Judy Malcolm; has two elder brothers and a younger sister named Amber Pyatt</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Hobbies and interests</td><td>Traveling, reading, music, fashion, photography</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kyle-Chrisley-wife-Alexus-Whilby.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life</h2><p>The wing of Chrisley’s fame has not extended up to Alexus. Even after her marriage to Kyle, Alexus continued to remain under the scope of media. As a result, very little is known about Alexus. Alexus Whilby was born in 1991 in Georgia to Isaac Samuel Whilby and Judy Malcolm, who are of African-American and Jamaican descent. She shared her childhood with her two elder brothers, Gregory Whilby and Patrick Whilby. Her father passed away on August 26, 2017. As far as her education goes, Alexus after completing high school attended Oglethorpe University and graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Biopsychology in 2014.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Professional Career</h2><p>After graduating from college, Alexus started working as an account manager for ALTA Language Services. She joined the company in 2014 and has been working with them ever since. She currently overlooks business development and is also the joint owner, manager, and director of Home Design & Business Development at Whilby’s Company, LLC. Alongside Kyle, Alexus also formed a band, Lexi & <a href=# rel=noopener>Kyle Chrisley</a>. The pair released their first ever single Shame on You. The single was released in 2014 but failed miserably. The single was so bad that the pair abandoned their musical careers and fans encouraged them to do so.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Meeting Kyle and Marriage</h2><p>Little is known about how and where Kyle and Alexus met. The pair have not shared details of their marriage. They tied the knot in 2014 and do not have any children, though Kyle has a daughter Chloe Chrisley from ex-partner Angel Victoria Johnson.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Helping Kyle Come Clean</h2><p>When Alexus first came into Kyle’s life, he was knee-deep in drugs. A celebrity kid, Kyle went down the wrong path. This led him to be estranged from his family and things continued to worsen from there. Without the support of his family, Kyle continued to take drugs and even had a daughter with his ex-girlfriend, Angela Victoria. Like Kyle, Angela was into drugs and as they both faced charges, Kyle’s daughter Chloe’s custody went to Todd Chrisley. While Kyle did file a lawsuit in 2013, asking for regular visits, the verdict was never revealed to the public.&nbsp;Alexus gradually helped Kyle overcome his drug problem and helped him come clean.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Divorce</h2><p>Kyle and Alexus seemed to have a happy and stable relationship for a few years. They even formed a musical duo called Lexi & Kyle Chrisley. They also appeared on a few episodes of Chrisley Knows Best, where they reconciled with Todd and the rest of the family. Kyle praised Alexus for being his “rock” and “saving” his life.</p><p>However, things took a turn for the worse in 2019, when Kyle reportedly threatened to kill Alexus during an argument. Alexus filed a complaint against him, and they separated shortly after. The exact reason for their separation is not clear, but it may have been related to Kyle’s mental health issues, which he admitted to have in an interview. He also revealed that he had attempted suicide in 2019, and was hospitalized for it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Life After Divorce</h2><p>Kyle Chrisley and Alexus Whilby’s relationship was once a source of hope and inspiration for many people who were facing similar challenges in their lives. They showed that love can overcome addiction, family drama, and personal struggles. However, their relationship also ended in tragedy and violence, as they could not cope with their differences and issues. Their story is a reminder that love is not always enough to sustain a relationship, and that sometimes people need to let go of each other for their own well-being.</p><p>Since their separation, Kyle married Ashleigh Nelson in 2021 and has been working as a real estate agent. He has also reconnected with his daughter Chloe, whom he had lost custody of due to his drug problems. He has apologized to his father and his family for his past mistakes and has thanked them for their love and forgiveness.</p><p>As of 2023, Whilby has not revealed much about her current activities or whereabouts.&nbsp;However, she has spoken out about her former in-laws’. She has expressed her opinion on Todd and Julie Chrisley’s sentencing for tax fraud and tax evasion.&nbsp;She <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that their sentencing was light considering their lack of accountability and that they were aware of what they were doing wrong.&nbsp;She called them the “modern-day Bonnie and Clyde” and said that they lied to obtain money from loans and to everyone about their wealth.&nbsp;She also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that she forgave Todd Chrisley in advance for his harsh words about her and that she was praying for him, Julie, and their entire family.</p><p>Whilby seems to have moved on from her tumultuous marriage and is focusing on her business and personal life. She has not been active on social media since 2019, so it is hard to know what she is doing as of 2023. However, based on her previous posts, she appears to be a religious and positive person who enjoys traveling, spending time with friends, and listening to music.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>FAQs</h2><ul><li>Q: Is Alexus Whilby an American citizen?</li><li>A: Yes, she is an American citizen.</li><li>Q: Is Alexus Whilby married to Kyle Chrisley?</li><li>A: No, she is not married to Kyle Chrisley anymore.&nbsp;They got divorced around 2019.</li><li>Q: Does Alexus Whilby have any children?</li><li>A: No, she does not have any children of her own.&nbsp;She was a stepmother to Kyle’s daughter Chloe from his previous relationship with Angela Johnson.</li><li>Q: Is Alexus Whilby a businesswoman?</li><li>A: Yes, she is a businesswoman who co-owns Home Designs & Business Development and Whilby’s Company, LLC.&nbsp;</li><li>Q: Is Alexus Whilby of Jamaican descent?</li><li>A: Yes, she is of Jamaican descent.
